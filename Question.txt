Deploy n (input) sensors randomly with communication range r (input) in a
rectangular of sides a & b (inputs) such that underlaying graph is
connected.

Apply following following topology control algorithms to compare
performance of the algorithms in terms of "stretch factor".

1. Cone based topology control (CBTC) (angle is input parameter)
2. Delaunay based Topology Control
3. Relative neighbor Topology Control

Draw input connected graph and output of above three algorithms.

Use any suitable language for implementation.
