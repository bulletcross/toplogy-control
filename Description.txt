n (input) sensors are deployed randomly with communication range r (input) in a
rectangular of sides a & b (inputs) such that underlaying graph is
connected.

Following topology control algorithms is applied to compare
performance of the algorithms in terms of "stretch factor".

1. Cone based topology control (CBTC) (angle is input parameter)
2. Delaunay based Topology Control
3. Relative neighbor Topology Control

Input connected graph and output of above three algorithms are reproduced in as gif.
